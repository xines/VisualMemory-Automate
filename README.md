# VisualMemory-Automate
Just a for fun method to automate a visual human benchmark checker at: https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/memory

### About the test
```
Every level, a number of tiles will flash white. Memorize them, and pick them again after the tiles are reset!

Levels get progressively more difficult, to challenge your skills.

If you miss 3 tiles on a level, you lose one life.

You have three lives.

Make it as far as you can!
```
